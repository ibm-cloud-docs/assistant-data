# Planning the dialog
{: #dialog-plan}

Learn how to approach building a dialog.
{: shortdesc}

- Plan out the design of the dialog that you want to build before you add a single dialog node. Sketch it out on paper, if necessary.
- Whenever possible, base your design decisions on data from real-world evidence and behaviors. Do not add nodes to handle a situation that someone *thinks* might occur.
- Avoid copying business processes as-is. They are rarely conversational.
- If people already use a process, examine how they approach it. People typically optimize the process from a conversational perspective.
- Decide on the tone, personality, and positioning of your assistant. Consistently reflect these choices in the dialog you create.
- Never misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.
- Not everything has to be a conversation. Sometimes a web form works better.
