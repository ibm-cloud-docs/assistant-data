# Making a programmatic call from dialog
{: #dialog-webhooks}

This feature became generally available in the 1.4.1 release. It was released as a beta feature with 1.4.
{: note}

To make a programmatic call, define a webhook that sends a POST request callout to an external application that performs a programmatic function. You can then invoke the webhook from one or more dialog nodes.

A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program. When used in a dialog skill, a webhook is triggered when the assistant processes a node that has a webhook enabled. The webhook collects data that you specify or that you collect from the user during the conversation and save in context variables. It sends the data as part of a HTTP POST request to the URL that you specify as part of your webhook definition. The URL that receives the webhook is the listener. It performs a predefined action using the information that you pass to it as specified in the webhook definition, and can optionally return a response.

You can use a webhook to do the following types of things:

- Validate information that you collected from the user.
- Interact with an external web service to get information. For example, you might check on the expected arrival time for a flight from an air traffic service or get a forecast from a weather service.
- Send requests to an external application, such as a restaurant reservation site, to complete a simple transaction on the user's behalf.
- Trigger a SMS notification.
- Trigger a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} web action.

You cannot use a webhook to call a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action that uses token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.
{: note}

For information about how to call a client application, see [Calling a client application from a dialog node](/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-actions-client).

## Defining the webhook
{: #dialog-webhooks-create}

You can define one webhook URL for a dialog skill, and then call the webhook from one or more dialog nodes.

The programmatic call to the external service must meet these requirements:

- The call must be a POST HTTP request.
- The format of the request and response must be in JSON. For example: `Content-Type: application/json`.
- The call must return in **8 seconds or less**.

  For less efficient services that you need to call, you can manage the call through a client application and pass the information to the dialog as a separate step. For more information, see [Calling a client application from a dialog node](/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-actions-client).
  {: tip}

To add the webhook details, complete the following steps:

1.  From the skill menu for the skill where you want to add the webhook, click **Options**.

1.  Click **Webhooks**.

1.  In the **URL** field, add the URL for the external application to which you want to send HTTP POST request callouts.

    For example, to call the Language Translator service, specify the URL for your service instance.

    ```bash
    https://api.us-south.language-translator.watson.cloud.ibm.com/v3/translate?version=2018-05-01
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    If the external application that you call returns a response, it must be able to send back a response in JSON format. For the Language Translator service, for example, you must specify the format in which you want the result to be returned. You can do so by passing a header to the service.

1.  In the Headers section, add any headers that you want to pass to the service one at a time by clicking **Add header**.

    For example, add a header that indicates that you want the resulting value to be returned in JSON format.

    <table>
    <caption>Header example</caption>
      <tr>
      <th>Header name</th>
      <th>Header value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Content-Type</td>
      <td>application/json</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  If the external service requires that you pass basic authentication credentials with the request, then provide them. Click **Add authorization**, add your credentials to the **User name** and **Password** fields, and then click **Save**.

    The product creates a base-64 encoded ASCII string from the credentials and generates a header that it adds to the page for you.

    <table>
    <caption>Header example</caption>
      <tr>
      <th>Header name</th>
      <th>Header value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Authorization</td>
      <td>Basic `<encoded-api-key>`</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    For testing purposes, you can submit an API key over basic authentication. Click **Add authorization**, and then add `apikey` to the **User name** field, and paste the API key value into the **Password** field. Click **Save**.
    {: tip}

Your webhook details are saved automatically.

## Adding a webhook callout to a dialog node
{: #dialog-webhooks-dialog-node-callout}

To use a webhook from a dialog node, you must enable webhooks on the node, and then add details for the callout.

1.  From the skill menu, click **Dialog**.

1.  Find the dialog node where you want to add a callout. The callout to the webhook will occur whenever this node is triggered during a conversation with a user.

    For example, you might want to send a callout to the webhook from the `#General_Greetings` node.

1.  Click to open the dialog node, and then click **Customize**.

1.  Scroll down to the *Webhooks* section, and switch the toggle to **On**, and then click **Apply**.

    If you did not have it enabled already, the *Multiple conditional responses* setting is switched on automatically and you cannot disable it. This setting is enabled to support adding different responses depending on the success or failure of the Webhook call. If you had a response specified for the node already, it becomes the first conditional response.
    {: note}

1.  Add any data that you want to pass to the external application as key and value pairs in the *Parameters* section.

    For example, if you call the Language Translator service, you must provide values for the following parameters:

    <table>
    <caption>Parameter example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>model_id</td>
        <td>"en-es"</td>
        <th>Identifies the input and output languages. In this example, the request is for text in English (en) to be translated into Spanish (es).</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>text</td>
        <td>"How are you?"</td>
        <th>This parameter contains the text string that you want the service to translate. You can hard code this value, pass a context variable, such as $saved_text, or pass the user input to the service directly, by specifying `<? input.text ?>` as this value.</th>
      </tr>
    </table>

    In more complex use cases, you might collect information during a conversation with a user about their travel plans, for example. You can collect dates and destination information and save it in context variables that you can pass to an external application as parameters.

    <table>
    <caption>Travel parameters example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>depart_date</td>
        <td>$departure</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>arrive_date</td>
        <td>$arrival</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>origin</td>
        <td>$origin</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>destination</td>
        <td>$destination</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  Any response made by the callout is saved to the return variable. You can rename the variable that is automatically added to the **Return variable** field for you. If the callout results in an error, this variable is set to `null`.

    The generated variable name has the syntax `webhook_result_n`, where the appended `_n` is incremented each time you add a webhook callout to a dialog node. This naming convention ensures that context variable names are unique across the dialog skill. If you change the name, be sure to use a unique name.

1.  In the conditional responses section, two response conditions are added automatically, one response to show when the webhook callout is successful and a return variable is sent back. And one response to show when the callout fails. You can edit these responses, and add more conditional responses to the node.

    - If the callout returns a response, and you know the format of the JSON response, then you can edit the dialog node response to include only the section of the response that you want to share with users.

      For example, the Language Translator service returns an object like this:

      ```json
         {
         "translations":[
            {"translation":"¿Cómo estás?"}
         ],
         "word_count":3,
         "character_count":12
         }
      ```
      {: codeblock}

      Use a SpEL expression that extracts only the translated text value.

      <table>
      <caption>Conditional responses example</caption>
        <tr>
          <th>Condition</th>
          <th>Response</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>$webhook_result_1</td>
          <td>Your words in Spanish: <? $webhook_result_1.translations[0].translation ?>.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>anything_else</td>
          <td>The call to the external application failed. Please try again later.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      If you use the recommended format for the response and the translation response shown earlier is returned, the assistant's response to the user would be: `Your words in Spanish: ¿Cómo estás?`

    - If you want to provide a specific response if the callout returns an empty string, meaning the call is successful, but the value returned is an empty string, you can add a conditional response that has a condition with syntax like this:

      ```
      $webhook_result_1.size() == 0
      ```
      {: codeblock}

1.  When you are done, click the X to close the node. Your changes are automatically saved.

## Testing webhooks
{: #dialog-webhooks-test}

When you first add a webhook callout, it can be useful to see exactly what is returned in the response from the external application, the data and its format. To do this, add this expression as the text response for the successful callout conditional response: `$webhook_result_n` where `n` is the appropriate number for the webhook you are testing.

This response returns the full body of the return variable, so you can see what the callout is sending back and decide what to share with the user. You can then use the methods documented in [Expression language methods](/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-methods) to extract only the information you care about from the response.

Test whether certain user inputs can generate errors in the callout, and build in ways to handle those situations. Errors generated by the external application are stored in `output.webhook_error.<result_variable>`. You can use a conditional response like this while you are testing to capture such errors:

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| output.webhook_error | The callout generated this error: <? output.webhook_error.webhook_result_1 ?>. |

For example, you might not be authenticating the request properly (401), or you might be trying to pass a parameter with a name that is already in use by the external application. Test the webhook to discover and fix these types of errors before you deploy the webhook.

## Removing a webhook
{: #dialog-webhooks-delete}

If you decide you do not want to make a webhook call from a dialog node, open the node's *Customize* page, and then switch Webhooks **Off**.

The *Parameters* section and the **Return variable** field are removed from the dialog node editor. However, any conditional responses that were added for you or that you added yourself remain.

The *Multiple conditioned responses* section is editable again. You can choose to switch the feature off. If you do so, then only the first conditional response is saved as the node's only text response.

To change the external service that you call from dialog nodes, edit the webhook details defined on the Webhooks page of the **Options** page. If the new service expects different parameters to be passed to it, be sure to update any dialog nodes that call it.

<!--## Calling IBM Cloud Functions
{: #dialog-webhooks-cf}

You write the webhook URL and provide headers differently based on whether you are calling a standard action or a web action.
-->
### Calling a web action
{: #dialog-webhooks-cf-web-action}

Typically, web actions can be run without requiring the caller to authenticate first. However, you can secure a web action that requires any callers to pass an ID with the request. For more information about how to secure a web action, see [Securing web actions](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions_web#actions_web_secure){: external}.

The following tips will help you call a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web action from your dialog.

1.  Open the **Options** page for the skill, and then click **Webhooks**.

1.  In the **URL** field, add the URL for the external application to which you want to send HTTP POST request callouts.

    For example, to call a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web action, specify the URL for the public web action. For example:

    ```bash
    https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/web/my_org_dev/default/Hello%20World.json
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    If the external application that you call returns a response, it must be able to send back a response in JSON format.

    Notice the request URL in this example ends in `.json`. By specifying this extension, you take advantage of a feature of web actions that lets you specify the desired content type of the response. Specifying this extension type ensures that, if the web actions can return responses in more than one format, a JSON response will be returned. See [Extra features](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions_web#actions_web_extra){: new_window} for more details.
    {: tip}

1.  You do not need to add any headers.

    {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web actions do not need to be authenticated, so you do not need to define an Authorization header.

    Your webhook details are saved automatically.

1.  From the skill menu, click **Dialog**.

1.  Click to open the dialog node from which you want to call the web action, and then click **Customize**.

1.  Scroll down to the *Webhooks* section, and switch the toggle to **On**, and then click **Apply**.

1.  Add any data that you want to pass to the external application as key and value pairs in the *Parameters* section.

    For example, if you call the Hello World {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web action, you might want to add the following information to pass in the message parameter that is accepted by that application:

    <table>
    <caption>Parameter example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Value</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>message</td>
        <td>"hello"</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    When calling a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web action, you cannot pass parameters with the same key as parameters that are defined as part of the web action. See [Protected parameters](/docs/openwhisk?topic=openwhisk-actions_web#protected-parameters){: new_window} for more details.
    {: note}

1.  You can edit the dialog node response to include only the section of the response that you want to display to users.

    The Hello World {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} web action includes a message name and value pair in its response, along with other information. To show only the content of the message, you can use `<return-variable>.message` syntax to extract the message section only from the response object.

    <table>
    <caption>Conditional responses example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Condition</th>
        <th>Response</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$webhook_result_1</td>
        <td>The application returned "$webhook_result_1.message".</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>anything_else</td>
        <td>The call to the external application failed. Please try again later.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  When you are done, click the X to close the node. Your changes are saved automatically.

<!--### Calling a standard action
{: #dialog-webhooks-cf-action}

You can make a call to an action that is managed by Cloud Foundry, but not to an action that uses token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

The {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} actions support both synchronous or asynchronous calls. However, you cannot make an asynchronous call to a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action with a webhook. When you send an asynchronous request, only an activation ID is returned.

To make a synchronous call to a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action that is managed by Cloud Foundry, complete the following steps:

1.  From the skill menu for the skill where you want to add the webhook, click **Options**.

1.  Click **Webhooks**.

1.  In the **URL** field, specify the URL for the action.

    Append a `?blocking=true` parameter to the action URL to force a synchronous call to be made.

    This syntax sends a synchronous request:

    ```bash
    https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com/api/v1/namespaces/my_org_dev/actions/Hello%20World?blocking=true
    ```
    {: codeblock}

    When you call an action, you must provide the API Key that is associated with the action as a header, which is described in the next step.

1.  Provide authorization details with the request.

    To call a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action that is managed by Cloud Foundry, complete the following steps:

    1.  Get the API Key. From the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} Endpoint page, find the CURL section and click the eye icon to show the key details. Copy the `user ID:password` key that is listed after the `-u` parameter in the curl command.

    1.  Click **Add authorization**, add your credentials to the **User name** and **Password** fields, and then click **Save**.

    The credentials are encoded and a header is generated and added to the page for you.

    ![Shows the URL field and Headers section of the Options page.](images/webhook-to-cfaction.png)

    - If you are calling a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action that is managed by IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) instead of Cloud Foundry, then you must provide an IAM bearer token to authenticate the request.

      1. Follow the instructions in [Passing an IBM Cloud IAM token to authenticate with a service's API](/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamapikeysforservices#token_auth).

      1. To pass the IAM bearer token, use a header like this:

         <table>
         <caption>Header example</caption>
           <tr>
             <th>Header name</th>
             <th>Header value</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td>Authorization</td>
             <td>Bearer `<IAM token>`</td>
           </tr>
         </table>

    Your webhook details are saved automatically.

1.  From the skill menu, click **Dialog**.

1.  Click to open the dialog node from which you want to call the web action, and then click **Customize**.

1.  Scroll down to the *Webhooks* section, and switch the toggle to **On**, and then click **Apply**.

1.  Add any data that you want to pass to the external application as key and value pairs in the *Parameters* section.

    When you call a {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} action, you *can* pass parameters with the same key as parameters that are defined as part of the action. The parameters are not reserved like they are for web actions.

1.  You can edit the dialog node response to include only the section of the response that you want to display to users.

    For example, in the conditional responses section, you can use an expression with the syntax `$webhook_result.response.result.message` to extract the returned message only.

    <table>
    <caption>Conditional responses example</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Condition</th>
        <th>Response</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>$webhook_result_1</td>
        <td>The application returned "$webhook_result.response.result.message".</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>anything_else</td>
        <td>The call to the external application failed. Please try again later.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

1.  When you are done, click the X to close the node. Your changes are automatically saved. -->
